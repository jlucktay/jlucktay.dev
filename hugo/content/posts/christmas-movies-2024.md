My partner and I tend to watch a fair few Christmas movies over the holiday break. We have some pretty [reliable regulars](https://letterboxd.com/film/elf/) in
the rotation, some [genuinely good stuff](https://letterboxd.com/film/home-alone/), and some [enjoyable guilty pleasure
trash](https://letterboxd.com/film/love-hard/). It's always fun finding [something new](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-holiday/), as well!

I try to log my viewing habits over at [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), and I even have a special tag [in the diary there, **just** for Christmas
movies](https://letterboxd.com/jlucktay/tag/christmas-%F0%9F%8E%84/diary/).

Then there is, of course, the time-honoured tradition of rewatching [the *Lord of the Rings*
trilogy](https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-lord-of-the-rings-collection/). I wouldn't say I've done this every single year since it came out, but probably
around about as many as not. The 4K Blu-ray box set I have on deck these days is **sublime**.

I'm not sure how or why this time of year came to be the slot for revisiting the trilogy, though I guess it's just that they were each released in the
Decembers of consecutive years, and that wasâ€¦ how many years ago now? Please don't tell me the answer. ðŸ˜…
